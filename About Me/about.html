<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a Product Lead, living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to be able to communicate my ideas by building great websites.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Founder with my own start-up because I like to work in a fast-paced, high-impact environment. If I could start any company, it would be a mix between a non-profit to help people get involved in their local and national politics, and an event company that organizes community events and music festivals.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>

<ul>
<br/><li><strong>Product Lead</strong>, General Assembly
<br/><em>NYC, 2014</em></li>

<br/><li><strong>Product Manager</strong>, General Assembly
<br/><em>NYC, 2012 - 2014</em></li>

<br/><li><strong>Trainer</strong>, Apple Inc.
<br/><em>NYC, 2007 - 2012</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>New York Film Academy, 2008
<br/>Florida Gulf Coast University, 2007</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

If there's one thing you need to know about me, it's my complete obsession with <a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/IThjAlJnD9WNO/giphy.gif">waving bears</a>.
